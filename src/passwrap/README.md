# passwrap

A simple archive-encrypt/decrypt-unarchive -er for sensitive but frequently updated content.

To be placed in the workflow at the beginning and end of each session. Content sits archived and encrypted on disk 99% of the time. When access is needed, passwrap decrypts and unarchives. When changes are finished, passwrap can wrap it back up.
